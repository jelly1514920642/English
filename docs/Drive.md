Old English drifan "to compel or urge to move, impel in some direction or manner; to hunt  (deer), pursue; to rush against" (class I strong verb; past tense draf, past participle drifen), from Proto-Germanic *dreibanan (source also of Old Frisian driva "I lead, impel, drive (away)," Old Saxon driban, Dutch drijven, Old High German triban, German treiben, Old Norse drifa, Gothic dreiban "to drive"), perhaps from PIE root *dhreibh- "to drive, push," but it may be a Germanic isolated word.

Used in Old English of nails, ships, plows, vehicles, cattle; in  Middle English of bargains. Meaning "compel or incite to action or  condition of any kind" (drive mad) is by  late 12c. Sense of "work with energy, labor actively" is c. 1200; that  of "aim a blow" is by early 14c.. Transitive meaning "convey (someone)  in a carriage," later an automobile, is from 1660s. The original sense  of "pushing from behind" was altered in Modern English by application to automobiles. Related: Driving.

 [OE] As far as is known, *drive* is an exclusively Germanic word. It and its relatives German *treiben*, Dutch *drijven*, Swedish *driva*, Danish *drive*, and Gothic *dreiban* point to a prehistoric Germanic ancestor **drīban*. Its base also produced English *drift* and *drove* [OE]. The central modern sense of *drive*, ‘drive a car’, comes from the earlier notion of driving a horse, ox,  etc by pushing it, whipping it, etc from behind, forcing it onwards, but in most other modern European languages the verb for ‘driving a  vehicle’ denotes basically ‘leading’ or ‘guiding’ (French *conduire*, for example, or German *lenken*).

*Drive* is one of those multi-functioning words with a lot of uses. In a very general sense it relates to pushing, or a push in a  direction; *drive* and *go* go hand in hand. You could drive  across country, drive cattle on a cattle drive, drive a golf ball by  hitting it off a tee, drive prey into the open, clean your computer’s  hard drive, or drive someone crazy. But do you really have the drive to  do all that?
