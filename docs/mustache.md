also *moustache* (chiefly[^1] British), "the hair that grows upon the upper[^2] lip[^3] of men," 1580s[^4], from French[^5] *moustache* (15c.), from Italian[^6] *mostaccio*, from Medieval[^7] Greek[^8] *moustakion*, diminutive[^9] of Doric[^10] *mystax* (genitive[^11] *mystakos*) "upper[^2] lip[^3], mustache," related to *mastax* "jaws[^12], mouth," literally[^13] "that with which one chews[^14]," perhaps from PIE root **mendh-* "to chew" (see [mandible](https://www.etymonline.com/word/mandible?ref=etymonline_crossreference)), but Beekes says this whole group of Greek words may be of Pre-Greek origin.

Borrowed earlier (1550s) as *mostacchi*, from the Italian word or its Spanish derivative *mostacho*. The plural form of this, *mustachios*, lingers in English (the *mustache* sometimes was considered as the hair on either side of the lip, hence the use of the plural form). Slang shortening *stache* attested from 1985. Old English had *cenep* "mustache," which is related to *cnafa* "boy" (see [knave](https://www.etymonline.com/word/knave?ref=etymonline_crossreference)). ***Mustache-cup***, one with a fixed cover over part of its top, allowing one to drink without dipping the mustache, is by 1868.

1580s, from French moustache (15c.), from Italian mostaccio, from  Medieval Greek moustakion, diminutive of Doric mystax (genitive  mystakos) "upper lip, mustache," related to mastax "jaws, mouth,"  literally "that with which one chews," from PIE root *mendh- "to chew"  (see mandible).Borrowed earlier (1550s) as mostacchi, from the Italian  word or its Spanish derivative mostacho. The plural form of this,  mustachios, lingers in English. Slang shortening stache attested from  1985. Dutch slang has a useful noun, de befborstel, to refer to the  mustache specifically as a tool for stimulating the clitoris; probably  from beffen "to stimulate the clitoris with the tongue."

If you're trying to grow a mustache, you might start by shaving all your facial hair except the strands that grow above your upper lip. When  your mustache becomes luxuriant and ample, you can trim it with scissors and style it with mustache wax. The word *mustache* comes from the French *moustache*, which has a Greek root, *mystax*, "upper lip."
